Semenoff \u0026rsquo;s supervision at PHAS , UBC. Here is my MSc Thesis, which has some physical misinterpretations, which were fixed on our paper.\nBefore that, I did my undergrad in mathematics at the Faculty of Sciences, UNAM, doing an undergrad thesis (written in Spanish) on Simulations of boson-fermion stars in 3+1 numerical relativity, directed by Dr. Miguel Alcubierre.\nIn case you were curious, my favourite physicist is Albert Einstein, my favourite mathematical physicist is Sir Roger Penrose and my favourite Mathematician is Sir Michael Atiyah.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve learned many things from the lectures and talks given at the Perimeter\u0026rsquo;s institute PIRSA. I recommend this blog for interesting discussions and good criticisms on current physics and mathematics as well as relevant news in these fields.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://d-shein.github.io/author/daniel-sheinbaum/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/daniel-sheinbaum/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Physics at CINVESTAV, working with Dr. Hugo García Compeán.\nBefore that I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry, UNAM working with Dr.","tags":null,"title":"Daniel Sheinbaum","type":"authors"}]
